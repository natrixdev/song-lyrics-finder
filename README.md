# Lyrics Search 
<br/><br/>
This code will create a window with a label asking the user to enter a song name, an entry field to type the name, a button to search the lyrics, a label to display the lyrics, and a label to display the source. When the user clicks the "Search Lyrics" button, the program will search the lyrics using the song name entered by the user, extract the lyrics and the source from the web page, and display them in the corresponding labels.

Note that this code uses the website "azlyrics.com" to search for the lyrics, and it assumes that the song name entered by the user is in the correct format used by the website. Also, web scraping can be a fragile technique as website structures change over time, so the code may not always work as expected.
